### Design Prompt: "Coro" Media Streaming App Authentication Flow

**Objective:**
Design a complete and visually cohesive user authentication flow for **"Coro,"** a modern, immersive mobile app for streaming music and video content.

**Core Concept:**
The app's brand identity is energetic, immersive, and entertainment-focused. The design must be visually stunning, using a dark-mode aesthetic contrasted with vibrant, glowing neon colors to create a "digital theater" or "late-night listening" vibe.

**Target Audience:**
Music lovers, binge-watchers, and users looking for a premium, on-demand entertainment experience.
